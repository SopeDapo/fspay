## üåê **Cross-Border Payment Flow**

FNGN enables seamless international money transfers with traditional banking integration.

### **Payment Process**
1. **Sender** deposits Naira via bank transfer or payment gateway
2. **FNGN minted** and credited to sender's wallet
3. **Blockchain transfer** initiated to recipient's wallet
4. **Recipient redeems** FNGN for local currency
5. **Bank settlement** completes the transaction

### **Benefits for Cross-Border Payments**
- **Speed**: Minutes instead of days
- **Cost**: Lower fees than traditional remittance services
- **Transparency**: Real-time transaction tracking
- **Security**: Blockchain-level security with bank settlement
- **Accessibility**: Works with existing banking infrastructure

## üè¢ **B2B Payment Gateway**

The B2B payment gateway enables businesses to send and receive payments using stablecoin technology while maintaining traditional business workflows.
